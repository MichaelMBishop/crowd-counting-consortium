# Crowd Counting Consortium Crowd Data
This repository stores a compiled and cleaned version of the [Crowd Counting Consortium](https://sites.google.com/view/crowdcountingconsortium/home)'s data on political crowds in the United States, including marches, protests, demonstrations, strikes, riots, and similar actions. Geocoordinates in this table come from the [Google Maps Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation).

This data set is updated weekly on Fridays not later than 4 PM Eastern time. It serves as the input to the Crowd Counting Consortium (CCC) Data Dashboard (coming soon), which, along with the compiled version of the data set posted here, is maintained by The [Nonviolent Action Lab](https://carrcenter.hks.harvard.edu/non-violent-social-movements), a research program within the [Carr Center for Human Rights Policy](https://carrcenter.hks.harvard.edu/) at the [Harvard Kennedy School](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/).

The CCC collects these data in the public interest and to further scholarly research. The CCC is not formally affiliated with any other efforts to collect data on demonstrations, though it collaborates with [Count Love](https://countlove.org/). Anyone who wishes to conduct research using the data is fully responsible for any necessary contact with their own Institutional Review Boards. If you wish to use these data, please include a citation to the “Crowd Counting Consortium.”

We recognize that [no large-scale data set on political crowds will ever capture all relevant events with 100% accuracy](https://willopines.wordpress.com/2014/03/03/no-more-fountains-of-youthpots-o-gold-conceptualization-and-events-data-part-1/). Even so, we aspire to make this record as complete and error-free as possible. If you see a record that you believe needs correcting, or if you are aware of a relevant event that is not included, please do *not* open an issue here to report it. Instead, please submit a record or correction via the CCC website, [here](https://sites.google.com/view/crowdcountingconsortium/submit-a-record).
